\opening{Dear Mr. Champion}

This report, titled "Learning Styles of A Computer Science Student", was prepared
for my 2A Work Report for PD2: Critical Reflection and Report Writing. This is
my first work term report.  The purpose of this report is to find learning styles of computer science students and transformations of learning styles in different environment.

As described in PD2 Course Outline, PD2 is designed to help students learn critical reflection and report writing. By finishing this course, I have learnt how to organize related materials, how to engage the reader and how to use a proper tone.

This report was written entirely by me and has not received any previous
academic credit at this or any other institution.


\closing{Regards,}
